This is the repository accompanying the paper <strong>Automatic semantic relation extraction</strong> which can be found [here](https://github.com/tot98git/fri-nlp-2022/blob/master/NLP_FRI_PAPER_2022.pdf).

Models were run independently for different experiments. They can be found on `src/models` with their respective instructions.

MTB-BERT model is available separately [here](https://github.com/ozbej/BERT-Relation-Extraction) with clear instructions on how to easily install prerequisites and run all the analysis.  
Entity Attention Bi-LSTM is available [here]([https://github.com/roomylee/entity-aware-relation-classification](https://github.com/gallindic/Attention-Based-BiLSTM-relation-extraction)).  
R-BERT is available [here](R-BERT).
